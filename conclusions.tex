\section{Conclusions}

All in all 5 out of the 6 stipulated experiments were completed and recorded as above. Primarily the learnings gained through these experiments conclude that the critical features to error probability reduction in pattern recognition and classification algorithms are ensuring an appropriate training data size which contains inside it the right characteristics around the covariance in the classes. Combined with the learnings from the first assignment in this course, it can be assessed that an accurate fit to data models is critical to ensuring accurate classification and that over-fitting or under-fitting can easily be experienced as optimal data sets are rarely realistic in practical applications. The randomized nature of a number of these experiments aided in reaching this conclusion.\\

It's also noted that different classifiers would have different strengths and weaknesses, as seen in utilizing the benefits of the k-Nearest Neighbour classifier to overcome the lack of training data and still improving the performance when compared to the Gaussian classifier used in most of the experiments here.
