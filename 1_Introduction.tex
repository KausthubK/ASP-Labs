\section{Introduction}\label{s:intro}
This report includes the documentation of a number of experiments carried out as stipulated by the handout provided. The six experiments attempted will explore the effect of the following variables on a pattern recognition system.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The effect of training sample size on classifier performance
	\item The effect of test set size on classifier performance
	\item The effect of the size of test set on the reliability of the empirical error count estimator
	\item To explore the relationship between class separability and error probability
	\item The effect, on the classifier error probability, of discrepancies between the true and assumed class probability distribution models.
	\item Comparing kNN with a Gaussian classifier.
\end{enumerate}

Experiments 1-4 and 6 will each be presented in the following sections, and though some attempt was made at Experiment 5, only a partial solution will be presented in this report.
