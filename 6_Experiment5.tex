\section{Experiment 5}
This experiment aims to investigate the effects of discrepancies between true and assumed class probability distributions, and how this may impact the classifier error probability. As classes with differing covariances are predicted by a model that ill-fits their class characteristics, the error probability would worsen. On the other hand when modelling the classifier against a subset of the actual test data, the characteristics between the training and test datasets would be more closely aligned, allowing for a more accurate classification error probability closer to the Bayesian optimal error.\\

\textbf{Unfortunately this experiment was left incomplete and the predictions above could not be fully substantiated.}
