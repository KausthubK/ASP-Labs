abstract = {Y o u r Q u e s t i o n s A n s w e r e d The layman's perspective on technical theory and practical applications of mapping and GIS " {\ldots}the main difference between the conventional lidar technology and lidar operating in Gieger mode (photon counting) technology is in the forms and methods that the back scattered light (or refl ected signal) is received and processed. " Question: I heard about a new technology in lidar called Geiger mode, what is it? Anonymous Reader Dr. Abdullah: The principle behind the operation of current lidar systems is based on a pulsed laser beam that is sent in a specifi c direction until it hits an object in its path. The pulsed light then interacts with molecules of the object and scatters in various directions with a portion refl ected back (backscattered) towards its origin (the lidar system). The backscattered light sent in the direction of the sensor is collected by telescopes and conducted into a detection unit (detector or receiver). After passing through fi lters, the signal (represented by photons) is received by a single element (i.e., non-pixilated) detector that detects and processes multi-photon returns. The new technology that you refer to differs from conventional lidar systems by splitting each pulse into an array of sub-pulses, each of which is considered to be a pulse on its own. Therefore, the main difference between the conventional lidar technology and lidar operating in Gieger mode (photon counting) technology is in the forms and methods that the back scattered light (or refl ected signal) is received and processed. Conventional lidar systems use lasers with suffi cient energy per pulse, in combination with optics of suffi cient aperture, to work with return signals of thousands of photons per shot. The high signal level approach requires laser repetition rates of hundreds of thousands of pulses per second to obtain contiguous coverage of the terrain at sub meter spatial resolution. Such requirements impact the design parameters of these systems and limit scalability in terms of power and hardware. In the last decade, a new paradigm in lidar design has evolved, utilizing the Geiger mode photon counting detector technology. The concept of Geiger mode, or photon counting-based lidar, is centered on creating an array of lidar point clouds from a single emitted laser pulse. The foundation of Geiger mode lidar is very light-sensitive, solid-state photodetectors. These devices are able to detect a low intensity incident fl ux of light (down to the single photon) and provide precise information on the number of photons arriving at the detector and their arrival time. In these lidar sensors, a relatively low energy laser (few micro joules) transmits in the form of sub nanosecond pulses at a high rate. The transmitted pulse then illuminates a ground surface area with a size that is dependent on fl ying altitude and laser aperture. The backscat-ter from the illuminated ground area is focused by a diffraction-limited telescope, or Diffractive Optical Element (DOE), and then projected onto a segmented single-photon-threshold Geiger-mode detector (receiver). The size, in terms of pixels, of the segmented anode can be tailored for each instrument. Some designs for the photon counting system are based on locating the DOE after the laser leaves the transmitter, resulting in multiple sub-pulses hitting the target. Each of these back-scattered sub-pulses is then directed by a telescope onto a single-photon-threshold Geiger-mode detector within the segmented (array) of detectors (See Figure 1).},

Several studies have investigated the discriminating power of wavelet-based features in various applications such as image compression, image denoising, and classification of natural textures. Recently, the curvelet and contourlet transforms have emerged as new multi-resolution analysis tools to deal with non-linear singularities present in the image. This article explores and proposes a texture based classification of remotely sensed multispectral images using features derived from the wavelet, curvelet and contourlet transforms. These features characterize the textural properties of the images and are used to train the classifier to recognize each texture class. Using these MRA based feature descriptors class separability is defined in feature space. The results are compared with Grey Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) based statistical features.},

Natural oil seeps can be detected as elongated, radar-dark slicks in SAR images. Use of SAR images for seep detection is enhanced by a Texture Classifying Neural Network Algorithm (TCNNA), which delineates areas where layers of floating oil suppress Bragg scattering. The effect is strongly influenced by wind strength and sea state. A multi orientation Leung-Malik filter bank [1] is used to identify slick shapes under projection of edges. By integrating ancillary data consisting of the incidence angle, descriptors of texture and environmental variables, considerable accuracy were added to the classification ability to discriminate false targets from oil slicks and look-alike pixels. The reliability of the TCNNA is measured after processing 71 images containing oil slicks.},

abstract = {Many remote-sensing satellites can obtain images in multispectral and panchromatic bands. By fusing low-resolution multispectral and high-resolution panchromatic images, one can obtain high-resolution multispectral images. In this paper, an image fusion algorithm based on image restoration is proposed to combine multispectral and panchromatic images. For remote-sensing satellites, the wavelength of the panchromatic band usually covers the wavelengths of the multispectral bands. This relationship between the two kinds of images is useful for fusion. In our approach, the low-resolution multispectral images are first resampled to the scale of the high-resolution panchromatic image. The relationship between these two kinds of images is then used to restore the resampled multispectral images. That is, the resampled multispectral images are modeled as the noisy blurred versions of the ideal multispectral images, and the high-resolution panchromatic image is modeled as a linear combination of the ideal multispectral images plus the observation noise. The ideal high-resolution multispectral images are then estimated based on the panchromatic and the resampled multispectral images. A closed-form solution of the fused images is derived here. Experiments show that the proposed fusion algorithm works effectively in integrating multispectral and panchromatic images.},

abstract = {Synthetic aperture radar in the application of remote sensing technology is becoming more and more widely because of its all-time and all-weather operation, feature extraction research in high resolution SAR image has become a hot topic of concern. In particular, with the continuous improvement of airborne SAR image resolution, image texture information become more abundant. It's of great significance to classification and extraction. In this paper, a novel method for built-up areas extraction using both statistical and structural features is proposed according to the built-up texture features. First of all, statistical texture features and structural features are respectively extracted by classical method of gray level co-occurrence matrix and method of variogram function, and the direction information is considered in this process. Next, feature weights are calculated innovatively according to the Bhattacharyya distance. Then, all features are weighted fusion. At last, the fused image is classified with K-means classification method and the built-up areas are extracted after post classification process. The proposed method has been tested by domestic airborne P band polarization SAR images, at the same time, two groups of experiments based on the method of statistical texture and the method of structural texture were carried out respectively. On the basis of qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis based on the built-up area selected artificially is enforced, in the relatively simple experimentation area, detection rate is more than 90{\%}, in the relatively complex experimentation area, detection rate is also higher than the other two methods. In the study-area, the results show that this method can effectively and accurately extract built-up areas in high resolution airborne SAR imagery.},

Dimensionality reduction of the hyperspectral image is performed prior to fusion in order to significantly reduce the computational time and make the method more robust to noise. Experiments are performed on a data set simulated using a real hyperspectral image. The results obtained show that the proposed approach is very promising when compared to conventional methods. This is especially true when the hyperspectral image is corrupted by additive noise.},

abstract = {Hyperspectral imaging, due to providing high spectral resolution images, is one of the most important tools in the remote sensing field. Because of technological restrictions hyperspectral sensors has a limited spatial resolution. On the other hand panchromatic image has a better spatial resolution. Combining this information together can provide a better understanding of the target scene. Spectral unmixing of mixed pixels in hyperspectral images results in spectral signature and abundance fractions of endmembers but gives no information about their location in a mixed pixel. In this paper we have used spectral unmixing results of hyperspectral images and segmentation results of panchromatic image for data fusion. The proposed method has been applied on simulated data using AVRIS Indian Pines datasets. Results show that this method can effectively combine information in hyperspectral and panchromatic images.},

abstract = {In this paper we propose a novel texture descriptor called Fractal Weighted Local Binary Pattern (FWLBP). The fractal dimension (FD) measure is relatively invariant to scale-changes, and presents a good correlation with human viewpoint of surface roughness. We have utilized this property to construct a scale-invariant descriptor. Here, the input image is sampled using an augmented form of the local binary pattern (LBP) over three different radii, and then used an indexing operation to assign FD weights to the collected samples. The final histogram of the descriptor has its features calculated using LBP, and its weights computed from the FD image. The proposed descriptor is scale invariant, and is also robust in rotation or reflection, and partially tolerant to noise and illumination changes. In addition, the local fractal dimension is relatively insensitive to the bi-Lipschitz transformations, whereas its extension is adequate to precisely discriminate the fundamental of texture primitives. Experiment results carried out on standard texture databases show that the proposed descriptor achieved better classification rates compared to the state-of-the-art descriptors.},

@article{Shahdoosti2015,
abstract = {Among the existing fusion algorithms, the wavelet fusion method is the most frequently discussed one in recent publications because the wavelet approach preserves the spectral characteristics of the multispectral image better than other methods. The Brovey is also a popular fusion method used for its ability in preserving the spatial information of the PAN image. This study presents a new fusion approach that integrates the advantages of both the Brovey (which preserves a high degree of spatial information) and the wavelet (which preserves a high degree of spectral information) techniques to reduce the colour distortion of fusion results. Visual and statistical analyzes show that the proposed algorithm clearly improves the merging quality in terms of: correlation coefficient and UIQI; compared to fusion methods including, IHS, Brovey, PCA , HPF, discrete wavelet transform (DWT), and a-trous wavelet. Introduction The satellites observating the earth provide two types of images: several high spectral/low spatial resolution multispectral (MS) images and a low-spectral/high spatial panchromatic (PAN) image. This complementary information are used by image fusion methods (or pan-sharpening methods) to obtain a fused image, having a high spectral/high spatial resolution, which is more informative and interpretative than both initial images. The most commonly used image-fusion methods are those based on the IHS (also known as HSI) [1], [2] and principal component analysis (PCA) [3], [4]. However, these methods can cause spectral distortion in the results [2]. Chavez proposed the HPF(High Pass Filtering) fusion algorithm which has shown better performance in terms of the high-quality synthesis of spectral information [5], [6]. The principle of this method is based on extracting the high-frequency information from the PAN image and injecting it into the MS image. The Box car filter is used for extracting the high-frequency information in this method. However, the ripple in the frequency response of box car filters has some negative impact on the fusion results. The well-known Mallat's fusion algorithm [7] uses an orthonormal basis and it can effectively preserve spectral information, but because of down-sampling operators which are used to implement ordinary discrete wavelet transforms, these transforms are not shift invariant and they can lead to problem in data fusion [8]. To avoid the above-mentioned problem, the discrete wavelet transform known as " {\`{a}} trous " algorithm [9-11] was proposed by eliminating the decimation operators in the wavelet structure. It is a shift-invariant and redundant wavelet transform algorithm based on a multiresolution dyadic scheme. Similar to Mallat's fusion algorithm, {\`{a}} trous can preserve the spectral information of MS images well. The Brovey method is based on the chromaticity transform [13], [14], [15]. It is a simple but powerful method for combining the data acquired by different sensors. The Brovey preserves the spatial information of PAN image well. However distortion of the spectral information is not acceptable in this method. To overcome the deficiency of the Brovey method, a new fusion approach is proposed in this paper. This new method integrates the advantages of both the Brovey (which preserves a high degree of spatial information) and the {\`{a}} trous (which preserves a high degree of spectral information) techniques to preserve both spatial and spectral information of PAN and MS images. To verify the efficiency of the proposed method, visual and statistical assessments are carried out on the MS and PAN data. {\`{A}} trous algorithm This section reviews the {\`{a}} trous fusion method as presented in [11],[15],[16] and briefly discusses the characteristics of these method. Two different strategies can be used in the {\`{a}} trous fusion method which are the additive wavelet (AW) and substitution wavelet (SW). The AW injects the high frequency wavelet planes of the PAN image directly into the MS image. Thus, the radiometric signature of the MS image is changed by this algorithm. This means that the AW method produces redundant geometric information. This method can be formulated as follow:},

Deep CNN have recently shown that they have a significant reconstruction performance on single-image super-resolution. Current trend is using deeper CNN layers to improve performance. However, deep models demand larger computation resources and is not suitable for network edge devices like mobile, tablet and IoT devices. Our model achieves state of the art reconstruction performance with at least 10 times lower calculation cost by Deep CNN with Residual Net, Skip Connection and Network in Network (DCSCN). A combination of Deep CNNs and Skip connection layers is used as a feature extractor for image features on both local and global area. Parallelized 1x1 CNNs, like the one called Network in Network, is also used for image reconstruction. That structure reduces the dimensions of the previous layer's output for faster computation with less information loss, and make it possible to process original images directly. Also we optimize the number of layers and filters of each CNN to significantly reduce the calculation cost. Thus, the proposed algorithm not only achieves the state of the art performance but also achieves faster and efficient computation.
